# Quick Start Guide - Loan Utilization App

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The **black screen issue** has been resolved! The app now properly initializes and displays the login screen.

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Fixed `main.dart` to use correct widget (`LoanUtilizationApp`)
2. ✅ Created missing `assets/` directory
3. ✅ Created missing `assets/icons/` directory  
4. ✅ Added placeholder SVG icons
5. ✅ Added comprehensive error handling

## 🚀 Running the App

### Option 1: Quick Run
```bash
flutter run
```

### Option 2: Clean Build (Recommended if you had issues before)
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Option 3: Specific Device
```bash
flutter devices  # List available devices
flutter run -d <device_id>
```

## 📱 What to Expect

### On First Launch:
1. **Login Screen** - You'll see a phone number input field
2. **No Black Screen** - The app will properly display UI
3. **Error Messages** - If Firebase isn't configured, you'll see a clear error message

### Authentication Flow:
- Enter mobile number → Get OTP → Enter OTP → Navigate to home screen

## ⚙️ Configuration Checklist

### Required (for full functionality):
- [ ] Firebase project created
- [ ] `google-services.json` added to `android/app/`
- [ ] Firebase Authentication enabled
- [ ] Phone authentication enabled in Firebase Console

### Optional (app will run without these):
- [ ] Replace placeholder icons in `assets/icons/`
- [ ] Configure backend API in `lib/core/utils/constants.dart`
- [ ] Set up database server

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Black Screen Still Appears?
```bash
# Try these steps in order:
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub upgrade
flutter run
```

### Firebase Errors?
- The app will still run but authentication won't work
- Add Firebase configuration files or disable Firebase temporarily

### Build Errors?
```bash
# Android
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..

# iOS
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

## 📂 Asset Management

### Current Assets:
```
assets/
└── icons/
    ├── app_logo.svg          # Main app logo
    ├── placeholder_avatar.svg # User avatar placeholder
    └── no_image.svg          # Missing image placeholder
```

### To Add Custom Assets:
1. Place your images in `assets/` or `assets/icons/`
2. Reference them in code: `Image.asset('assets/your_image.png')`
3. Already configured in `pubspec.yaml` ✅

## 🎯 Next Steps

### For Development:
1. Configure Firebase (see Firebase setup guide)
2. Replace placeholder icons with branded assets
3. Test authentication flow
4. Configure backend API endpoints

### For Testing:
1. Run on physical device for location/camera features
2. Test offline functionality
3. Test data sync when coming back online

4. Android/iOS build logs

### Common Solutions:
